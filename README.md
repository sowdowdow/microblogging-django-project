This project is (proudly ?) made in french.

The goal of this one is to learn **Python**, **Django** and **TDD** at the same time *ough* !
The concept is simple, a **public blog** where anybody can register and write some articles, delete or modify them.

- The practice of Test Driven Development is implemented through *Django* and tests are run by *TravisCI*.

- Users are implemented through Django's Users while Posts are made by hand.

| Constraints |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| As a user I can register an account and I can login |
| As a user I can login in order to create a new *entry* |
| As a user I can create a new *Post* in order to share informations with people. |
| As a user I can *modify* and *delete* my posts |
| As a visitor, I have access to a listing of latest posts on the index page |
| As a visitor I can see all the publications from a user (on many pages if necessary) in order to read more from him |
